Heat sinks / Sources
Die of old age

Sources for new cells (5x5 grid of randomly spawning cells)

Colored cells for extra dimensions
(color of cell corresponds with heat storage, cells release heat and
fall into different colors per tick until death. Rewrite rules depend on color configuration of neighbors)

Add GLEW in a platform agnostic way

Bit mask in shaders

Custom one-time compute workgroup/layout size optimization program

Shader optimizer (run through configurations of work groups and find the best one)
