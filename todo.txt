Heat sinks / Sources
Die of old age

Sources for new cells (5x5 grid of randomly spawning cells)

Colored cells for extra dimensions
(color of cell corresponds with heat storage, cells release heat and
fall into different colors per tick until death. Rewrite rules depend on color configuration of neighbors)

Add GLEW in a platform agnostic way

Bit mask in shaders

Custom one-time compute workgroup/layout size optimization program

Shader optimizer (run through configurations of work groups and find the best one)

cmake should rebuild SDL for debug builds

Setting the wrong uniform datatype (i.e unsigned int to an int) is a problem. Should probably 
define a static map of constants for that somewhere

I want to have a single string that determines the rewrite rule for the entire system
https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Rulestring

Simple case: Game of life
The most common notation for rulestrings 

B{number list}/S{number list}; 

this is referred to as the birth/survival notation, and is sometimes called 
the rulestring of the CA in question. B (for birth) is a list of all the numbers 
of live neighbors that cause a dead cell to come alive (be born); S (for survival)
is a list of all the numbers of live neighbors that cause a live cell to remain 
alive (survive).

The rulestring of Conway's Game of Life is B3/S23.

More complicated case: Larger than Life

Rr,Cc,Ssranges,Bbranges,Nn

Here:
- Rr specifies the range (r is from 1 to 500 in Golly and LifeViewer; 1 to 10 in MCell).
- Cc specifies the number of states (c is from 0 to 255 in Golly and LifeViewer)
- Ss specifies the survival conditions, which are numbers separated by commas. Ranges of 
consecutive numbers can be contracted via dashes; e.g. S6,7,8,13,14,18 can be expressed as S6-8,13-14,18
- Bb specifies the birth conditions, which are numbers separated by commas. Ranges of consecutive numbers 
can be contracted via dashes; e.g. B6,7,8,13,14,18 can be expressed as B6-8,13-14,18
- Nn specifies the extended neighborhood type (n is M for Moore or N for von Neumann. 
Golly and LifeViewer also support C for Circular neighborhood. LifeViewer additionally 
supports 2 for L2, + for Cross, X for Saltire and * for Star neighborhoods and many more). 
For Moore, this parameter is omitted.

My case:
Automata Layer:
- Considers 3x3 grid neighbors, optionally the middle cell
- ??

New ideas:
- Neural CA
- Cell-specific genome neural celluar automata
    - Bit packing
    - Assume rgba32ui (can go smaller)
    - Bits 0-a (bools/1 bit) (maybe for program use / optimization)
        - Self:
            - isAlive
            - hasNeighbor(Up/Down/Left/Right)
            - ...
        - Neighbors (* 8):
            - Everything from self
    - Bits a-b (Integers/2-8 bits)
        - Self:
            - energy
            - timeAlive
            - ...
        -  Neighbors
            - ....
    - ...
    - Aribtrary Memory?
        - Self memory
        - Incoming memory
        - Outgoing memory

    Has possible actions
    - Move up, left, right, down
    - Attack up, left, right, down
    - Reproduce up, left, ... (reproduce with mutations)
    (What if another cell is blocking?) = ignore except attack
        

    Need some update rule scheme
    - New layer, rgba32f (2x 16f = 8 FP16 total)
    - Each of the 8 FP16 is a weight
    - I can make a mini NN
    - Input layer = ...
    - 2 Hidden layers
    - Output layer = action (softmax)

    Update pipeline:
    - Set states (isAlive etc.)
    - Perform NN forward pass
    - Do action

In the fully formed GUI program, I want to be able to make different creature structures and shaders at runtime.
