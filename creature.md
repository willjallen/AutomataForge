- **Cell-specific Genome Neural Cellular Automata**
    - **Bit Packing**
        - **Assume rgba32ui (can go smaller)**
        - **Bits 0-a (Booleans/1 bit) (maybe for program use / optimization)**
            - **Self (Properties):**
                - isAlive
                - markedForBirth
                - markedForDeath

            - **Neighbors (\* 8):**

    - **Bits a-b (Integers/2-8 bits)**
        - **Self:**
            - energy (0 to 255)
            - timeAlive
            - reproductionCount
            - mutationRate
            - attackPower
            - defensePower
            - reproductionSpeed
            - mobilitySpeed*
        - **Neighbors:**
            - energy
            - timeAlive
            - reproductionCount
            - mutationRate

    - **Arbitrary Memory?**
        - **Self memory:** (stores historical actions, status, etc.)
        - **Incoming memory:** (communication from other cells)
        - **Outgoing memory:** (communication to other cells)

    **Possible Actions:**
    - Move up, left, right, down
    - Attack up, left, right, down
    - Reproduce up, left, right, down (with mutations)
    - Communicate up, left, right, down
    - Consume energy
    - Place pheremone
    - Die

    **Need Some Update Rule Scheme**
    - **New layer, rgba32f (2x 16f = 8 FP16 total)**
        - Each of the 8 FP16 is a weight
    - **Mini Neural Network:**
        - **Input layer:** (cell status, neighbors' status, etc.)
        - **2 Hidden layers:** (with activation functions)
        - **Output layer:** (action, softmax)
    
    **Update Pipeline:**
    - Set states 
      - energy
      - timeAlive
      - ...
    - (Sync)
    - PlanMove
    - (Sync)
    - Perform NN forward pass
    - Execute action (move, attack, reproduce, etc.)
    - Update environment (energy consumption, cell deaths, etc.)
